# Nuxt 3 Full Stack Developer Assignment

This project is a full-stack application developed using Nuxt 3, Prisma, and MySQL. It includes features for managing categories and products, image resizing, and a structured API setup.

## Project Overview

The project implements CRUD operations for categories and products. It features categories displayed as a tree structure, with the ability to count products within nested categories. Images uploaded for products are resized to 3200x3200 pixels. The project is containerized using Docker for easy deployment.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend & Backend:** Nuxt 3
- **Database:** MySQL
- **ORM:** Prisma
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **API Testing:** Postman

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (v14 or above)
- npm, pnpm, yarn, or bun (package managers)
- Docker
- MySQL

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

Use your preferred package manager to install the required dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install

```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set the following environment variables:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/database_name"

# Cloud service credentials (example: Cloudinary)
CLOUD_NAME=<add-your-cloudname>
API_KEY=<add-your-apikey>
API_SECRET=<add-your-apisecret>
```

Replace `user`, `password`, and `database_name` with your actual MySQL credentials.

### 3. Database Setup

Run Prisma migrations to set up the database schema:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

### 4. Seed the Database (Optional)
